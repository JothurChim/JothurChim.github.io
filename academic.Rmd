What makes us uniquely human? To me, one thing is our ability to abstract the real world into mental concepts, or even invent entirely mental, abstract concepts that do not have a real world or physical correspondence. The earliest methods in which we are able to do this by is via language and mathematics. So, how do they take shape? How do we think? How do we abstractify the world? How do we make sense of such complex systems of abstraction? How do we use these tools of abstraction in an everyday social context? These are questions that should be answered to make sense of the human experience.
