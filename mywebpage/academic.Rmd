title: "Academic content"
---

This is where I'll publish academic content. Not much for now!

I would be interested in pursuing research in the following areas generally:


- Language and cognition, especially in bilingual communities

- Second language acquisition with focus on English

- Intelligence, especially regarding the nature of *g*, and its connections with language faculties

- Parapsychology
