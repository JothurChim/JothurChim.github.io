I would be interested in pursuing research in the following areas generally:


- Language and cognition, especially in bilingual communities

- Second language acquisition with focus on English

- Mathematical cognition and its connections with language faculties

- Intelligence, especially regarding the nature of *g*, and its connections with language faculties

I am however not limited to these areas and am willing to pursue study in related fields, such as linguistics.
