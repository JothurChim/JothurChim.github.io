### Who am I?

I'm a psychology student at the University of Bath who is interested in the areas of language, mathematical cognition and their intersections.

I'm currently engaged with research activities within the Department of Psychology as a research apprentice.

I currently have the **right to remain in the UK** under the [Hong Kong British National (Overseas) Visa Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/british-national-overseas-bno-visa).

### About this website

built with R ([R Core Team, 2025](https://www.R-project.org)), in RStudio ([Posit team, 2025](http://www.posit.co/)). I learnt how to build this website with the aid of the University of Glasgow's "Data Skills for Reproducible Research" online textbook ([DeBruine et al., 2024](https://psyteachr.github.io/reprores-v4/)).
