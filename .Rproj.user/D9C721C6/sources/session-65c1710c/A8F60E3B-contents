What makes us uniquely human? To me, one thing is our ability to abstract the real world into mental concepts, or even invent entirely mental, abstract concepts that do not have a real world or physical correspondence. The earliest methods in which we are able to do this by is via language and mathematics. So, how do they take shape? How do we think? How do we abstractify the world? How do we make sense of such complex systems of abstraction? Can it go in an unexpected trajectory? These are questions that should be answered to make sense of the human experience.

### Current interests

I would be interested in pursuing research in the following areas generally:


- Language and cognition, for example in bilingual communities and language processing

- Second language acquisition

- Mathematical cognition and its connections with language faculties

- Intelligence and its connections with language faculties

I am however not limited to these areas and am willing to pursue study in related fields, such as first language acquisition.
