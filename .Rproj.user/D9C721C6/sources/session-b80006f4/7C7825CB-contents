I would be interested in pursuing research in the following areas generally:


- Language and cognition, for example in bilingual communities and language processing

- Second language acquisition

- Mathematical cognition and its connections with language faculties

- Intelligence and its connections with language faculties

I am however not limited to these areas and am willing to pursue study in related fields, such as first language acquisition.
